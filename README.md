# Goal
The aim of the project is to make a LLVM Compiler and learn what goes into making a language. I'm going to model the syntax and design after languages that I'm most familiar with, C style code.

# TODO:

- Write a lexer to tokenize source code
- Parser converts tokens into AST 
- Ensure correct code (type-checking etc...) write tests
- Code gen AST -> LLVM IR
